//! Deterministic companion to the `fuzz_liquidate_close_factor` fuzz target.
//!
//! The fuzz target drives `LendingContract::liquidate` end-to-end with random
//! `(collateral, debt, amount)` states and asserts a set of post-state
//! invariants. This module pins the same invariant checks to the explicit edge
//! cases the issue calls out — tiny debt, huge collateral, the unhealthy
//! boundary, close-factor cap enforcement, and near-overflow seizures — so the
//! success / `PositionHealthy` / `Overflow` branches are each provably reached
//! and the invariant oracle is exercised under plain `cargo test` (no
//! cargo-fuzz / nightly required).
