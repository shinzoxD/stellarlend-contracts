## Features

- **Collateralized Borrowing**: Borrow assets by providing collateral with configurable liquidation thresholds.
- **Interest Accrual**: Automatic interest calculation based on protocol parameters.
- **Risk Management**: Protocol-level debt ceilings, deposit caps, and liquidation incentives.
- **Flash Loans**: Zero-collateral, single-transaction loans with configurable fees.
- **Granular Pausing**: Ability to pause specific operations (Deposit, Borrow, Repay, Withdraw, Liquidation) or the entire protocol.
- **Emergency Lifecycle**: `Normal -> Shutdown -> Recovery -> Normal` flow for handling catastrophic events.
- **Multi-sig Governance**: Secure upgrade mechanism requiring multiple approvals.
- **Persistent Data Store**: Versatile storage system with backup/restore and migration capabilities.
- **Arithmetic Safety**: Protection against overflow/underflow using checked arithmetic.
- **Indexable Events**: Versioned event emission for all core operations (deposit, withdraw, borrow, repay, liquidate) enabling off-chain indexing and monitoring.

## Contract Interface

The table below reflects the **shipping** surface of `src/lib.rs` as of this branch. Functions marked **🔮 Planned** do not exist yet.

### Initialization

| Function | Signature | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `initialize` | `(env, admin: Address)` | — | One-time setup; sets admin and initial `EmergencyState::Normal`. Reverts if already initialized. |
| `get_admin` | `(env) → Address` | — | Returns the current admin address. |
| `propose_admin` | `(env, new_admin: Address)` | current admin | Step 1 of two-step admin transfer. Stores the proposed address. |
| `accept_admin` | `(env)` | proposed admin | Step 2: accepts the role committed by `propose_admin`. |
| `set_guardian` | `(env, guardian: Address)` | admin | Stores the guardian address allowed to enter `Shutdown`. |
| `get_guardian` | `(env) → Option<Address>` | — | Returns the configured guardian address, if any. |

### User Operations

| Function | Signature | Auth | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `deposit` | `(env, user: Address, amount: i128) → Result<i128, LendingError>` | `user` | New collateral balance | Adds `amount` to the user's collateral. Enforces deposit cap. Blocked during Shutdown. |
| `withdraw` | `(env, user: Address, amount: i128) → Result<i128, LendingError>` | `user` | New collateral balance | Removes `amount` from the user's collateral. Only allowed in Normal and Recovery states. |

| `repay` | `(env, user: Address, amount: i128) → Result<i128, LendingError>` | `user` | Remaining debt principal | Reduces user debt with interest accrued up to the current timestamp. Allowed in Normal and Recovery. |

```

## Event Emission

The lending contract emits versioned events for all core fund-moving operations to enable off-chain indexing, monitoring, and analytics.

### Emitted Events

All events carry a `schema_version` field for safe decoding across contract upgrades. Current schema version: `1`

- **SchemaVersionEvent**: Emitted once during `initialize()` to anchor the active schema version for indexers.
- **DepositEvent**: Emitted when a user deposits collateral. Contains user address, amount deposited, new collateral balance, and timestamp.
- **WithdrawEvent**: Emitted when a user withdraws collateral. Contains user address, amount withdrawn, new collateral balance, and timestamp.
- **BorrowEvent**: Emitted when a user borrows against collateral. Contains user address, amount borrowed, new debt principal, and timestamp.
- **RepayEvent**: Emitted when a user repays debt. Contains user address, amount repaid, new debt principal, and timestamp.
- **LiquidateEvent**: Emitted when a liquidator liquidates an undercollateralized position. Contains liquidator address, borrower address, repaid debt amount, seized collateral amount, borrower's remaining debt, borrower's remaining collateral, and timestamp.

### Event Guarantees

- Events are emitted **only on successful operations** after state mutations complete.
- Events **do not expose sensitive data** (e.g., private keys, authentication tokens).
- Event field order is **stable** within a schema version.
- Schema version changes follow the **upgrade policy** defined in `docs/EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSIONING.md`.

### Indexer Integration

For detailed guidance on consuming these events in indexers and handling schema migrations, see:
- [Event Schema Versioning Guide](../../../docs/EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSIONING.md)

Example: Decoding a DepositEvent in TypeScript
```typescript
interface DepositEvent {
  schema_version: number;
  user: string;
  amount: bigint;
  new_balance: bigint;
  timestamp: number;
}

function decodeDepositEvent(eventData: any): DepositEvent {
  if (eventData.schema_version !== 1) {
    throw new Error(`Unsupported schema version: ${eventData.schema_version}`);
  }
  return {
    schema_version: eventData.schema_version,
    user: eventData.user,
    amount: BigInt(eventData.amount),
    new_balance: BigInt(eventData.new_balance),
    timestamp: eventData.timestamp
  };
}
```

## View Serialization Stability

The contract treats the current struct-returning getter responses as view schema `v1`.

Covered getters:

- `get_user_debt() -> DebtPosition`
- `get_user_collateral() -> BorrowCollateral`
- `get_user_collateral_deposit() -> DepositCollateral`
- `get_user_position() -> UserPositionSummary`

Wire-format guarantee:

- Soroban `#[contracttype]` structs encode as XDR maps keyed by field name.
- The generated conversion code sorts those keys lexicographically, so the on-wire key order is deterministic.
- Snapshot-style tests lock the current XDR encoding for the getter structs above.

Stable decoding guidance:

- Decode these responses by field name, not by source declaration order.
- Treat the current field set and field names as schema `v1`.
- Do not assume a new field can be added safely to an existing getter response. Even additive changes can break strict decoders and hash-based snapshots.

Versioning strategy:

- Existing getter response structs are preserved in place for schema `v1`.
- Any additive or breaking change to one of the getter structs must ship as a new versioned getter/type, for example `get_user_position_v2()`, instead of mutating the current response shape.
- A runtime `schema` field is intentionally not added to the existing structs because that would itself be a breaking ABI change for the current getter surface.

## Contract Interface

### Flash Loan Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Lending Contract
    participant R as Receiver Contract
    C->>R: 1. Send Loaned Amount
    Note right of R: 2. Execute Flash Loan Logic
    R->>C: 3. Repay Amount + Fee
    C->>C: 4. Verify Repayment
```

## Security & Trust Boundaries

### Authorization & Access Control
- **Admin**: Manages risk parameters, emergency state, and admin handoff.
- **Guardian**: Optionally stored at `DataKey::Guardian`; falls back to admin if not set. Authorized to call `set_emergency_state` and `set_pause`.
- **User**: `deposit`, `withdraw`, `borrow`, `repay` each call `user.require_auth()`.
- **Liquidator**: `liquidate` calls `liquidator.require_auth()`.

### Execution Safety
- **Reentrancy**: Flash loans set `DataKey::FlashActive = true` before the external call and clear it after. `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `repay` panic if the guard is active.
- **Arithmetic Integrity**: All storage mutations use `checked_add` / `checked_sub`; overflows return `LendingError::Overflow` or panic with an informative message.
- **Multi-User Isolation**: Storage keys include the user `Address` (e.g., `DataKey::Collateral(user)`), guaranteeing strict per-address namespacing — verified by `test_multi_user_isolation` in `src/lib.rs`.
